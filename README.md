# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

#Task

For this week's assignment we needed to create a random password generator that took user inputs to create the password. We did this by writing a function that selected the userinput to randomly call numbers, letters, and characters to generate a password.

I worked on this assignment with another classmate.
